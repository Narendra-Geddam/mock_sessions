# SECTION 1: COMPLETE INTERVIEW ANALYSIS AND PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION MATERIAL

Interaction Number: 1

Interviewer: Arvind kumar  
Candidate: Chandrashekhar K M  

Full Professional Interview Question:  
Explain your end-to-end Jenkins CI/CD pipeline architecture and how microservices are built and deployed into Kubernetes production environments.

Candidate Answer:  
Candidate explained that Jenkins pipeline receives manual input, builds microservices using Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, Helm charts, and deploys to Kubernetes using kubectl and Helm. They mentioned using a central library for common pipeline logic across microservices.

Instructor Correction or Expectation:  
Instructor expected a clearer structured explanation covering pipeline stages, CI vs CD separation, automation logic, artifact creation, registry push, deployment automation, and environment promotion.

Professional Interview Answer (DETAILED AND PRECISE):  
A production-grade Jenkins CI/CD pipeline follows structured stages:

CI Pipeline (Continuous Integration):

- Developer pushes code to Git repository
- Jenkins triggers pipeline via webhook
- Jenkins pulls code from Git
- Code quality analysis performed (SonarQube, Snyk)
- Application is compiled and tested
- Docker image is built using Dockerfile
- Docker image is tagged with version (example: app:v1.0.0)
- Docker image pushed to container registry (Docker Hub, ECR, ACR)

CD Pipeline (Continuous Deployment):

- Jenkins pulls deployment configuration (Helm charts)
- Uses Helm to deploy application to Kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes pulls image from registry
- Deployment object created or updated
- Kubernetes scheduler assigns pods to worker nodes
- Pods started and services exposed

Central Shared Library:

- Jenkins Shared Library contains reusable pipeline logic
- Helps standardize pipeline across microservices
- Reduces duplication
- Improves maintainability

Real-world flow:

Git → Jenkins → Build → Docker Image → Push to Registry → Helm Deploy → Kubernetes Cluster

Scenario Variations Interviewers May Ask:

- How do you implement rollback in Jenkins pipeline?
- How do you deploy to multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)?
- How do you secure secrets in Jenkins pipeline?

Key Concepts You Must Study:

- Jenkins Pipeline architecture
- CI vs CD lifecycle
- Docker build and registry integration
- Helm deployment process

Exact Preparation Required:

- Build Jenkins pipeline from scratch
- Create Jenkinsfile deploying microservice

Interaction Number: 2

Interviewer: Arvind kumar  
Candidate: Chandrashekhar K M  

Full Professional Interview Question:  
Explain different Kubernetes deployment strategies and when you would use them.

Candidate Answer:  
Candidate explained rollout strategy and blue-green deployment. Mentioned gradual pod replacement and traffic switching between blue and green environments.

Instructor Correction or Expectation:  
Instructor expected clearer explanation of rollout, blue-green, canary, and real production use cases.

Professional Interview Answer (DETAILED AND PRECISE):

Rolling Deployment:

- Default Kubernetes deployment strategy
- Gradually replaces old pods with new pods
- Ensures zero downtime
- Controlled using:

maxUnavailable  
maxSurge  

Blue-Green Deployment:

- Two environments:

Blue → current version  
Green → new version  

- Traffic switched from Blue to Green
- Fast rollback possible

Canary Deployment:

- Deploy new version to small percentage of users
- Monitor performance
- Gradually increase traffic

Use Cases:

Rolling → Standard deployments  
Blue-Green → Critical applications  
Canary → Risk-sensitive applications

Scenario Variations Interviewers May Ask:

- How do you implement canary deployment in Kubernetes?
- How do you rollback deployment?

Key Concepts You Must Study:

- Deployment controller
- ReplicaSets
- Rollout strategy configuration

Exact Preparation Required:

Practice rollout commands:

kubectl rollout status deployment/app  
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app

Full Professional Interview Question:  
How do you backup Kubernetes cluster and applications?

Candidate Answer:  
Candidate mentioned Velero for application backup and etcd snapshot using etcdctl.

Instructor Correction or Expectation:  
Answer correct but lacked structure and real production explanation.

Professional Interview Answer:

Two types of Kubernetes backup:

ETCD Backup (Cluster-level backup)

ETCD stores:
